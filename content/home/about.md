# Biography

I am a second year masters student at the Language Technologies Institute at School of Computing Sciences, CMU. I am advised by Prof. Jaime Carbonell and Prof William Cohen. I am also currently doing an independent study with Dr Yulia Tsvetkov.

My interests lie primarily in the areas of text generation with structural and domain constraints. I am exploring models to incorporate domain beliefs and structural biases (dependency structures, story narrative chains, etc) as priors to improve generation.

Previously, I completed my bachelors from PESIT, Bangalore and worked at Flipkart, India for 2 years.

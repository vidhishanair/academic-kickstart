# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "While document summarization in the pre-neural era significantly relied on modeling the interpretable structure of a document, the state of the art neural LSTM-based models for single document summarization encode the document as a sequence of tokens, without modeling the inherent document structure. In this work, we explore inducing latent sentence dependency structures for the task of single-document summarization, with the dual goal of improving the summaries and learning interpretable structured document representations. We leverage structure-aware encoders which have shown to be useful for document classification tasks and adapt it for text summarization"

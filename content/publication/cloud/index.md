abstract = "Hybrid clouds help in establishing a cost effective, reliable and scalable solution to limitations in traditional on-premise data-center. There is an increasing requirement for federated hybrid cloud solutions to allow private clouds to leverage different public cloud providers. Federated cloud solutions should accommodate infrastructure constraints, balance load between different clouds and keep the cost at a minimal for the client. The following paper proposes an architecture for hybrid clouds called Simple Cloud Federation (SCF). It differs from existing architectures in that it leverages the hierarchical organization features already found in existing cloud systems. It is thus general and easy to implement across a variety of cloud systems, including OpenStack and Amazon. The paper contains details of our OpenStack implementation."
#abstract_short = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."

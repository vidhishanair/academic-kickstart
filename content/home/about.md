# Biography

I am a first year PhD student at the Language Technologies Institute at School of Computing Sciences, CMU. I am advised by Prof. Jaime Carbonell and Prof. Yulia Tsvetkov. I completed my masters at LTI in 2019, advised by Prof. William Cohen. I also spent an amazing summer as a Research Intern with Google AI hosted by Dr William Cohen and Dr Michael Collins.

My interests lie primarily in improving document representations using structural and knowledge biases. Previously, I have worked on incorporating domain beliefs and structural biases (dependency structures, story narrative chains, etc) as priors to improve generation.

Previously, I completed my bachelors from PESIT, Bangalore and worked at Flipkart, India for 2 years.
